# Project README

This is a Python project that includes several functions for handling various tasks. The functions provided in this project include:

1. `safe_print_list`: A function to print the first `x` elements of a list.
2. `safe_print_integer`: A function to print an integer with formatting.
3. `safe_print_list_integers`: A function to print the first `x` integers from a list.
4. `safe_print_division`: A function to divide two integers and print the result.
5. `list_division`: A function to divide two lists element by element.
6. `raise_exception`: A function to raise a `TypeError` exception.
7. `raise_exception_msg`: A function to raise a `NameError` exception with a message.

## Usage

This section provides an overview of how to use each function in your project:

### `safe_print_list`

- `safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0)` can be used to print the first `x` elements of a list, handling exceptions and returning the real number of elements printed.

### `safe_print_integer`

- `safe_print_integer(value)` prints an integer with formatting using `"{:d}".format()`, handling exceptions and returning `True` if the value is an integer, otherwise `False`.

### `safe_print_list_integers`

- `safe_print_list_integers(my_list=[], x=0)` prints the first `x` integers from a list, handling exceptions, and returning the real number of integers printed. It raises an `IndexError` if `x` is larger than the list length.

### `safe_print_division`

- `safe_print_division(a, b)` divides two integers, prints the result with formatting using `"{:d}".format()`, and handles exceptions. It returns the division result, or `None` in case of errors.

### `list_division`

- `list_division(my_list_1, my_list_2, list_length)` divides two lists element by element, handling various error cases such as division by zero, wrong types, and list length discrepancies.

### `raise_exception`

- `raise_exception()` raises a `TypeError` exception.

### `raise_exception_msg`

- `raise_exception_msg(message="")` raises a `NameError` exception with a specified message.

Please refer to the individual functions for more details on how to use them.
